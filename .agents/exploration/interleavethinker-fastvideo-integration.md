# Exploration Log: InterleaveThinker FastVideo Integration

## Status

Draft handoff, shortened on 2026-06-21 and updated on 2026-06-22 after
official InterleaveThinker parity validation.

Current working location:

- Directory: `/home/toolbox/FastVideo`
- Branch: `interleavethinker`
- Latest completed integration checkpoint:
  `7219b3b7` (`[refactor]: add non-diffusion role model base`)
- Latest observed branch head before the official parity patch:
  `9363caf6` (`[docs] record InterleaveThinker workflow namespace correction`)

This file is the canonical handoff for the InterleaveThinker integration work.
It intentionally summarizes older execution logs; use git history for the full
append-only detail if needed.

## Current Hard Instructions

- Work in `/home/toolbox/FastVideo` on the checked-out branch.
- Do not add standalone InterleaveThinker `fastvideo` subcommands such as
  `interleave-run`, `interleave-serve`, or `interleave-eval`.
- Do not add a separate InterleaveThinker HTTP API surface unless strictly
  necessary.
- Keep useful additions integrated into existing FastVideo library and training
  surfaces.
- Keep this handoff updated before context compaction, interruption, or a major
  direction change.
- Make focused commits as frequently as useful; push committed checkpoints when
  validation evidence should be durable.
- Do not run tests on the local machine. The local environment is not reliable
  for this work because both hardware and software prerequisites are missing.
- Run validation on Modal through `fastvideo/tests/modal/launch_l40s_job.py`.
  L40S is the normal target, but H100 or B200-class GPUs may be used when the
  task needs more memory or speed. Check Modal availability before relying on a
  specific larger GPU type.
- User approval is already granted for all Modal actions needed to finish this
  task set, including running jobs and uploading files or uncommitted patches
  from `/home/toolbox/FastVideo`.
- Prefer FastVideo's modular `fastvideo/train` stack for new training work.
  Do not migrate legacy `fastvideo/training` pipelines unless explicitly asked.
- Do not vendor InterleaveThinker, EasyR1, LLaMA-Factory, or their full training
  stacks into FastVideo.
- Planner and critic are Transformers Qwen3-VL `RoleModelBase` wrappers, not native
  FastVideo DiT components. A native Qwen3-VL port should happen only if
  checkpoint conversion, distribution, or performance requirements justify it.
- Boundaries:
  - VLM model details live in planner/critic model wrappers.
  - RL algorithms live in `fastvideo/train/methods/rl`.
  - Reward parsing/scoring lives under `fastvideo/train/methods/rl/rewards`.
  - Interleaved inference helpers live under
    `fastvideo/workflow/interleave_thinker`; use the pre-existing singular
    `fastvideo/workflow` namespace, not a parallel `fastvideo/workflows`
    package.

## Goal

Add a native FastVideo integration surface for InterleaveThinker-style workflows:

- run planner -> generator/edit -> critic loops through reusable Python helpers;
- train/fine-tune planner and critic Qwen3-VL actors through FastVideo YAML
  configs and the modular trainer;
- support InterleaveThinker SFT, critic GRPO, planner GRPO, reward parsing, and
  trace/evaluation utilities;
- keep tests deterministic with fake backends, and reserve real-checkpoint
  validation for Modal.

Out of scope unless explicitly re-opened:

- standalone FastVideo CLI commands dedicated to InterleaveThinker;
- a separate InterleaveThinker HTTP API/server surface;
- full-parameter 8B training as a default path;
- deterministic regression tests against live closed-source services.

## Architecture Snapshot

Implemented and retained surfaces:

- `fastvideo.workflow.interleave_thinker`
  - schema objects, generator backend translation, orchestrator, provider
    adapters, config/runner helpers, prompt-set evaluation, and trace metrics.
  - Standalone command registration and standalone server modules were removed.
- `fastvideo.train.models.interleave_thinker`
  - shared Qwen3-VL actor base;
  - planner wrapper for `InterleaveThinker/InterleaveThinker-Planner-8B`;
  - critic wrapper for `InterleaveThinker/Critic-SFT-8B`;
  - dataset normalization for planner SFT/RL and critic SFT/RL files.
- `fastvideo.train.methods.fine_tuning.interleave_thinker_sft`
  - response-token-only SFT for planner and critic.
- `fastvideo.train.methods.rl.interleave_thinker`
  - GRPO-style managed RL loop with grouped rollouts, old logprobs, optional
    frozen reference policy KL, and LoRA-first configs.
- `fastvideo.train.methods.rl.rewards.interleave_thinker`
  - critic reward parser/scorer and planner format/plan reward utilities.
- `examples/train/configs/interleave_thinker/`
  - planner and critic SFT LoRA configs.
- `examples/train/configs/rl/interleave_thinker/`
  - critic and planner GRPO LoRA configs.
- `docs/design/interleave_thinker.md`
  - review/design entrypoint that should stay shorter and more reviewer-facing
    than this exploration file.

Removed by the API/CLI cleanup:

- Interleave-specific `fastvideo` subcommand registration.
- Standalone Interleave compatibility server.
- command/service-oriented examples and scripts.
- `interleave-api` optional extra.

Namespace integration status:

- Completed correction. The reusable helper layer lives under the pre-existing
  singular `fastvideo/workflow/interleave_thinker` package, not under a new
  parallel `fastvideo/workflows` package.
- Internal imports, tests, examples, docs, and this handoff now use
  `fastvideo.workflow.interleave_thinker`.
- The old `fastvideo.entrypoints.interleave` package remains deleted rather
  than kept as a compatibility shim. This branch has not merged, so preserving
  the old public path is not required.
- Do not scatter the helper code into unrelated core modules unless a genuinely
  generic abstraction emerges. The planner -> generator/edit -> critic loop is
  InterleaveThinker-specific workflow code, not `VideoGenerator`, training
  method, or reward-parser core behavior.

## Condensed Execution History

- Initial service/orchestration slice added Interleave request/trace schema,
  generator request translation, fake-provider tests, and an early compatibility
  service. The later cleanup removed the standalone service/CLI surface but kept
  reusable Python helpers.
- Critic backend hardening added Gemini/Nano Banana-style API wrappers with lazy
  imports, fake-client tests, and no live API calls in CI-style tests.
- Real critic smoke loaded `InterleaveThinker/Critic-SFT-8B` on Modal L40S with
  `Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct` and produced a non-empty response.
- Shared actor/planner work added a shared Qwen3-VL actor base,
  `InterleaveThinkerPlannerModel`, planner parsing, and real planner/critic
  smokes. Commit: `3b9ecb34`.
- Provider adapters wired planner and critic model wrappers into the native
  `InterleaveOrchestrator`; real planner + fake generator + real critic smoke
  passed. Commit: `2d3bb7c7`.
- Native run/config helpers were added and validated with a real FastVideo
  FLUX.2-klein generator smoke. Later cleanup removed dedicated command
  registration while keeping reusable helper code. Commits included
  `ee4021e5` and `375b944b`.
- Dataset normalization added support for upstream planner SFT, critic SFT,
  critic RL, and planner RL formats with image path resolution and clear data
  errors. Commit: `dcd82f93`.
- Planner/critic SFT added response-token-only supervised fine-tuning and
  LoRA-first configs. Commit: `df88af31`.
- Critic GRPO upgraded from advantage-weighted NLL to response-token logprob
  policy loss with PPO/GRPO ratio, clipping, optional KL input, and metrics.
  Commit: `b7a923c0`.
- PEFT LoRA was added for Qwen actors after FastVideo's native DiT LoRA wrapper
  failed on HF Qwen modules. Real one-step critic RL smoke then passed.
  Commit: `0cc04784`.
- Optional frozen reference policy KL was added through `models.reference` and
  validated with a real one-step critic RL reference smoke. Commit: `42c2fe6a`.
- Planner GRPO added planner rollouts, planner rewards, `planner_rl` data, and
  real one-step planner RL smoke. Commit: `2cf9aa0d`.
- Prompt-set evaluation and trace metrics/report helpers were added as reusable
  Python/library surfaces. Commits included `eca14441`, `874e4e2f`,
  `022aedb0`, and `47335f09`.
- Review package added `docs/design/interleave_thinker.md` and MkDocs nav.
  Commit: `6a6ebf1e`.
- API/CLI cleanup removed standalone InterleaveThinker FastVideo commands and
  the separate server, restored normal parser behavior, and rewrote docs toward
  library/training integration. Commits: `555a600f`, `704e5667`.
- Handoff instructions were condensed and updated with standing Modal approval
  and the no-local-tests rule. Commit: `d2c53951`.
- Namespace integration first moved the helper package to
  `fastvideo.workflows.interleave_thinker`, renamed stale tests, updated docs
  and examples, and deleted the old entrypoints package. Commits: `11d55fb5`,
  `91d8fb85`.
- Follow-up correction requested by the user: move the helper package into the
  pre-existing singular `fastvideo.workflow.interleave_thinker` namespace and
  remove the parallel `fastvideo.workflows` package. Commit: `bb1e8935`.
- Official parity hardening aligned planner, guidance-planner, and critic
  prompt literals with upstream InterleaveThinker; matched the upstream demo
  message constructor for text/image interleaving including the `max_pixels`
  behavior for five or more images; and adjusted Qwen generation so
  official-style single-output inference preserves checkpoint generation config
  while multi-output/custom-sampling RL paths still pass sampling controls.
  Commit: `f04e6750`.
- Abstraction cleanup introduced `RoleModelBase` as the minimal non-diffusion
  training role base, made diffusion `ModelBase` inherit from it, moved
  `Qwen3VLActorBase` off the diffusion contract, removed the actor dummy
  scheduler and diffusion stubs, and added explicit Interleave SFT/RL actor
  protocols. This preserves existing diffusion method contracts while making
  planner/critic actors honest non-diffusion role models. Commit: `7219b3b7`.

    `pre-commit run --files pyproject.toml fastvideo/train/models/interleave_thinker/planner.py fastvideo/train/models/interleave_thinker/critic.py fastvideo/train/models/interleave_thinker/qwen_actor.py tests/local_tests/test_interleave_thinker_planner_model.py tests/local_tests/test_interleave_thinker_critic_model.py tests/local_tests/test_interleave_thinker_official_parity.py`
  - Result: yapf, ruff, codespell, PyMarkdown, actionlint, mypy, filename check,
    and suggestion passed or were correctly skipped when no files applied.
- Local validation for the parity patch was limited to syntax and diff hygiene:
  - `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python -m py_compile ...` passed for touched
    Python files.
  - `git diff --check` passed.
  - No local pytest was run.
- Abstraction cleanup validation:
  - Local syntax/diff hygiene only:
    `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python -m py_compile ...` passed for touched
    Python files, and `git diff --check` passed.
  - Focused InterleaveThinker regression validation passed on Modal L40S:
    app URL `https://modal.com/apps/hao-ai-lab/main/ap-75XUQvgThU5DvYENqoJTek`;
    result `62 passed, 14 warnings`.

    app URL `https://modal.com/apps/hao-ai-lab/main/ap-k1Dtgm9E4gAOKvkHQCVgjM`;
    result `69 passed, 14 warnings`.
  - A broader train-method Modal run including Wan single-step tests produced
    `69 passed, 2 failed, 15 warnings`; the two failing Wan test targets also
    failed on an unpatched branch-head comparison job. Treat those failures as
    current Modal image / upstream test-environment issues, not regressions from
    the role-model abstraction slice.
    - Patched broader run:
      `https://modal.com/apps/hao-ai-lab/main/ap-X0UxJwUHohtnEU1RQ8lho6`.
    - Unpatched comparison:
      `https://modal.com/apps/hao-ai-lab/main/ap-ZdMTgR8UP9KhYPHEXR1PAi`.
  - Official InterleaveThinker parity passed on Modal L40S with upstream cloned
    in-job and `INTERLEAVETHINKER_REAL_PARITY=1`:
    app URL `https://modal.com/apps/hao-ai-lab/main/ap-h2OM9Yst0VuoYDAded9Qll`;
    result `5 passed, 14 warnings`.
  - Modal pre-commit on touched files passed:
    app URL `https://modal.com/apps/hao-ai-lab/main/ap-blSbeLVjX6lkE4MZp9TTmq`;
    yapf, ruff, codespell, PyMarkdown, mypy, filename check, and suggestion
    passed or were correctly skipped when no files applied.
  - No local pytest was run.
- Training pipeline dry-run validation, completed 2026-06-27:
  - Goal: exercise the modular training entrypoint
    `fastvideo.train.entrypoint.train --dry-run` with the public
    InterleaveThinker YAML configs, temporary in-job fixtures, single-GPU
    distributed overrides, and SDPA attention overrides.
  - Planner and critic SFT dry-runs passed on Modal L40S:
    app URL `https://modal.com/apps/hao-ai-lab/main/ap-BFk8R8SB47o1CL7l2SbZHk`.
    Both commands loaded the real Qwen3-VL checkpoint, enabled PEFT LoRA, built
    the dataloader/method via `build_from_config()`, and printed
    `Dry-run: config parsed and build_from_config succeeded.`
  - Planner and critic GRPO dry-runs passed on Modal H100:
    app URL `https://modal.com/apps/hao-ai-lab/main/ap-UZ80OpsMVwwj2guheCf4pN`.
    These commands loaded the real trainable student plus frozen reference
    Qwen3-VL checkpoints, enabled PEFT LoRA on the student, built temporary
    planner/critic RL dataloaders and `InterleaveThinkerRLMethod`, and printed
    the same dry-run success line. H100 was used for this slice because each RL
    config instantiates both student and reference checkpoints in one process.
  - No training steps were executed in these dry-runs; the entrypoint returns
    immediately after `build_from_config()` succeeds. No local pytest was run.

Broad-suite status:

- Local broad `pytest tests/ fastvideo/tests/ -q` is not a reliable signal on
  this machine due missing GPU/runtime dependencies, blocked Hugging Face
  downloads, missing SSIM references, missing `flashinfer`, and missing GUI
  libraries for `cv2`.
- Broad Modal attempts did not produce a clean full-suite result. Known blockers
  included `flashinfer` absence in the dev image and collection/import fallout
  during combined suite runs. Treat focused Modal suites plus targeted API/CLI
  regressions as the current evidence until the broad-suite environment is
  repaired.

## Current Risks And Decisions

- One-process memory residency for real planner + real critic + real generator
  is still not the recommended default. The validated approach separates heavy
  concerns or uses fake/lightweight providers for orchestration tests.
- Live Gemini/Nano Banana behavior can change and may incur cost or rate
  limits. Unit tests must use fake clients; live API runs should be recorded as
  smoke evidence only.
- HF model/dataset access may require tokens and may change over time. Keep
  tiny checked-in fixtures for parser, loader, and reward tests.
- Full-parameter 8B training is unvalidated. LoRA is the supported first path.
- Broad test validation needs a better Modal/dev image or a documented skip
  strategy for tests requiring unavailable packages and external downloads.
- Keep the standalone CLI/API cleanup intact unless the user explicitly reverses
  that product decision.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. For code work, continue from `/home/toolbox/FastVideo` on
   `interleavethinker` and inspect `git status --short --branch`
   before editing.
2. Read the relevant per-directory `AGENTS.md` before touching files under
   `fastvideo/`, `examples/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`, or tests.
3. The API cleanup, namespace correction, official parity hardening, and
   abstraction cleanup are complete. No further implementation step from the
   current structural-divergence plan is pending.
4. Validate only on Modal. Local syntax-only commands such as `git diff --check`
   are acceptable, but no local pytest or other local test execution should be
   used.
5. Good next work items are PR decomposition/review packaging, broad-suite Modal
   image repair for the known Wan/DTensor and memory failures, or reward/backend
   hardening if product requirements call for it.

## Useful Commands

```bash
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline -12
git diff --check
pre-commit run --files <changed paths>
```

Use Modal for all test execution and authoritative validation.
